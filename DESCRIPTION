GlslViewer is a flexible console-base OpenGL Sandbox to display 2D/3D GLSL shaders that support to:

    * fragment and vertex shaders on GLSL from versions 100 to 430 (depending on your OS driver)
    * resolve #include dependencies
    * adding/deleting #define keys through console IN commands and OSC
    * automatically generated set of defines based on the platform, buffer, render pass, geometry attributes and materials properties.
    * passing custom uniforms (float, int, vec2, vec3 and vec4) through console IN or OSC
    * Different kinds of Textures (png, bmp, jpg, tga, hdr, gif, mp4, mov, rtc, rtsp, local camera devices and audio textures)
    * import of Cubemaps and spherical harmonics (png, jpg, tga, hdr)
    * import LST, PLY, OBJ or GLTF files (and their dependencies)
    * default vert/frag shaders for 2D shader and 3D material shaders with PBR lighting model
    * hot reload of files on changes
    * One default light and one default camera
    * Interactive commands thought POSIX console IN/OUT or OSC
    * different debug modes (histogram, textures, buffers, bounding box, etc)
    * shadow maps
    * headless rendering
    * fullscreen and screensaver mode
    * HoloPlay rendering on LookingGlass Display
    * image export
    * PNG sequence export
    * WASM compilation using emscripten
