The Debian Package glslviewer
----------------------------

GlslViewer is a flexible console-base OpenGL Sandbox to display 2D/3D GLSL shaders without the need of an UI. 
Joing #GlslViewer channel on https://shader.zone/ to learn how to use it, share work and get help.


GlslViewer is a flexible console-base OpenGL Sandbox to display 2D/3D GLSL shaders that support to:

* fragment and vertex shaders on GLSL 120
* resolve #include dependencies
* adding/deleting #define keys through console IN commands and OSC
* automatically generated set of defines based on the platform, buffer, render pass, geometry attributes and materials properties.
* passing custom uniforms (float, int, vec2, vec3 and vec4) through console IN or OSC
* Different kinds of Textures (png, bmp, jpg, tga, hdr, gif, mp4, mov, rtc, rtsp, local camera devices and audio textures)
* import of Cubemaps and spherical harmonics (png, jpg, tga, hdr)
* import LST, PLY, OBJ or GLTF files (and their dependencies)
* default vert/frag shaders for 2D shader and 3D material shaders with PBR lighting model
* hot reload of files on changes
* One default light and one default camera
* Interactive commands thought POSIX console IN/OUT or OSC
* different debug modes (histogram, textures, buffers, bounding box, etc)
* shadow maps
* headless rendering
* fullscreen and screensaver mode
* HoloPlay rendering on LookingGlass Display
* image export
* PNG sequence export
